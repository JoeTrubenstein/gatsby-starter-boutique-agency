## It was nearly 2:00 AM on a Saturday night

and I was in the last place I had hoped to be spending my weekends at 26. I was on my hands and knees arranging jars of artichoke hearts and I still had three more shelves to go. As much as every fiber of my being was screaming for me to run for the door, I was still in no rush to go home. This was because my latest living arrangement was also in the category of “places I had hoped not to find myself at this age.” I knew that as soon as I was done sweeping up the store, that there was no place to go besides back to my air mattress, about 7 feet from my newest, yet also oldest roommate.

It only took about three nights on my dad’s floor in Staten Island to realize that I missed the couch I had been sleeping on in Syracuse. I kept reminding myself that it was only temporary, that after a couple weeks of resumes and interviews, I’d be right back to being on top of the world. To me, that just meant a tiny apartment with a couple of dudes and a playstation. So in the beginning, I was optimistic. It seemed like a very reasonable short term goal for someone with my qualifications, I couldn’t see any reason why I wouldn’t be able to just get in and get out. I asked myself, “How hard could it really be?”

A few weeks earlier, I had closed my eyes and prayed to God that I would follow whatever path he laid out for me, so long as he would get me out of Syracuse by the end of the summer. It was now almost winter and I was really beginning to second guess having entered that arrangement. It seemed that the lord in his infinite wisdom had taken the opportunity to reiterate the importance of perspective to me. Because once again, I had failed to learn my lesson. Just when things had seemed their darkest, the cold hand of fate had risen from the smoke, just in time to make a fist that would then would then proceed directly into my nose.

## I hadn’t been careful what I wished for.

I told myself all I needed was a steady check and health insurance. Now I had both of those things, but at what cost? I was working past midnight almost every single day. My days off were Monday and Tuesday. My social life had all but ceased to exist. The majority of those with whom I spent my working hours with absolutely despised me. I didn’t really blame them. I got to a point where I would just scroll down my entire contact list, asking myself if I could justify trying to turn any of these names back into friends. The answer was almost always no.

For a while I did nothing. Without even realizing it, I had fallen into a routine. I didn’t even bat an eye when I was picking up my ridiculous floral work shirts from the dry cleaners, like it was the most normal thing in the world. By February, I had finally saved up enough to rent myself an apartment near the college I had just graduated from. Slowly but surely, I even began to see some old friends. I visited my favorite Rutgers bars on my nights off and started to look forward to doing so.

It was the first night of passover when I finally asked myself the question.

## “What am I doing?”

I was standing on the sidewalk across from an old girlfriend and she was crying. It wasn't a flashback. I had actually driven out there to spend the occasion with her and her family. She went back into her house and I got into my car.

I suddenly felt like I had taken a thousand steps backwards.

When I was 18 years old I joined the army on a promise I made to myself, that I would rather risk my life than continue to live in New Jersey and work in grocery stores. It had been nearly a decade since I made that decision, and the realization that it hadn’t changed anything hit me so hard that I became physically ill. I had been so caught up in complaining about the job itself that I had lost sight of the bigger picture. I felt like throwing up so much that I had to pull over.

I walked into a Quick Chek and bought a diet Arizona green tea and a pack of Camel menthols. I knew that a time-out with two of my favorite things would calm me down at least a little bit. I decided that I would allow myself this short break, then I would immediately come up with a plan to wake myself up from the nightmare my life had become. I came back outside and sat down on the curb. I started talking to myself out loud.

>"How are we going to get out of this?"
