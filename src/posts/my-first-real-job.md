## I’ve misread my fair share of situations in life. 

I’ll admit that. But for the most part, doing so has never resulted in any truly dire consequences for me. That’s why I’ve always behaved the way that I do. Even in my most foolish lapses of judgment I’ve usually managed to get away with little more than hurt feelings. (Except for the one time I was kicked in the face while seated in the back of my friend’s Celica.) This was all of course until summer of 2016, when I failed to spot a metaphorical iceberg that would take almost three years to recover both emotionally and financially from colliding with. It was my first time navigating the waters of office politics, and I had a U-boat stalking me from day one.

Just over a month later, I was emptying the contents of my desk into a cardboard box that was handed to me at roughly 2pm on a Tuesday. It was my first “real job”, and it couldn’t have come at a worse time because I had finally secured a means out of the closet. Not that closet. The literal closet that my landlord was illegally renting to me in New Brunswick. And now I wasn’t going to have the 500 bucks I needed to give him on the first. Worse yet, I had been rubbing this new career change in the faces of everyone who came within earshot of me. All these thoughts were circling in my head as I looked around the office for any form of support at all, be it someone shaking their head in disagreement or even a confused shrug. I got nothing. No one would even dare make eye contact with me. 

*For the first time in my life I opened my mouth to try and add some levity to the situation, but I blanked. No words came out. I closed the door behind me and headed for the car.*

My beloved Lancer had died and I was borrowing my dad’s 2004 Honda Element with a broken exhaust that was leaking carbon monoxide into the cab. He had been asking for it back, and for a moment I considered that he would most likely be none too pleased to discover the amount of cigarettes I had been smoking in it. I sat in the parking lot with the box of pens and mugs in my lap and lit another Marlboro menthol with the one I had just finished. I looked out over the Raritan Bay. A comforting thought entered my mind. There was no way the car would smell like cigarettes by the time they pulled it out of the marina. If I floored it just to the left of the boat launch, I could probably catch some decent air before I hit the water.

## I had a lot of memories in the strange little car.

 In my teenage years my buddies and I had treated it like an RV, driving 12 hours to concerts and camping out. I closed my eyes and thought about the time a dear friend and I had gone fishing in those very same waters two years before. I thought about how much fun we had just drinking and screaming as if fishing were the most daring and extreme form of entertainment in existence. Then I remembered how I needed him to take the eel off my hook because I was too scared of it.

My meditation ended as I was quickly reminded what an enormous coward I was and still remain to this day. How was I going to drive off a pier if I didn’t have the courage to touch fish? My head started vibrating as I finished the 3rd or 4th cigarette in a row. I was going to have to come up with another plan and I was going to have to come up with one fast. Then I did something even more frightening than the prospect of trying to escape a sinking car. I called my dad and told him what happened.

## He was actually very cool about it.

Within a few minutes I started to feel a little bit better about everything. By about 3, it felt like nothing more than having the afternoon off. I was still anxious, but it didn’t feel quite like the end of the world anymore. I got back in the car and drove to my friends house. They weren’t home but their dad was sitting with the garage door open, smoking a cigar. He waved me inside.

>“What’s up, Joe?”
>
>“I got fired today.”
>
>“That new place you were so excited about?”
>
>“That’s the one.”

He was drinking some weird Polish brandy. He pushed the bottle over to me without saying anything else. I had plenty of cigarettes and I really liked that chair. I would figure out what to do in the morning.
